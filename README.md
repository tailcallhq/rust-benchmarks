### Introduction

While building [Tailcall], we frequently engage in internal debates about the low-level design of our application. One recurring topic is pattern matching versus dynamic dispatch. This repository aims to explore two fundamental concepts: **pattern matching** and **dynamic dispatch**, and understand the actual differences in performance.

[Tailcall]: https://github.com/tailcallhq/tailcall

Based on the benchmark results, pattern matching in Rust is significantly faster than dynamic dispatchâ€”no surprise there! The execution times indicate that pattern matching, at around 320 picoseconds per operation, is roughly **72,000 times faster** than dynamic dispatch, which operates at around 23 nanoseconds on the lower end of the spectrum.
