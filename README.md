While building [Tailcall], we frequently engage in internal debates about the low-level design of our application. One recurring topic is pattern matching versus dynamic dispatch. This repository aims to explore two fundamental concepts: **pattern matching** and **dynamic dispatch**, and understand the actual differences in performance.

[Tailcall]: https://github.com/tailcallhq/tailcall

Based on the benchmark results, pattern matching in Rust is significantly faster than dynamic dispatchâ€”no surprise there! The execution times indicate that pattern matching, at around 320 picoseconds per operation, is roughly **72,000 times faster** than dynamic dispatch, which operates at around 23 nanoseconds on the lower end of the spectrum.

## Update 1

We were curious to see why pattern matching was significantly faster compared to dynamic dispatch, so we posted benchmarks on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1cx7qvi/performance_pattern_matching_vs_dynamic_dispatch/). We received interesting feedback about the benchmark setup, such as the unnecessary heap allocation for dynamic dispatch. After addressing this, the performance difference was marginal.

Digging deeper, especially after this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/tailcallhq/rust-benchmarks/issues/2) and further analysis on [Rust Compiler Explorer](https://rust.godbolt.org/), we discovered that the compiler optimizes the generated machine code based on the seed value set in the variable `output`. When set to `0`, the additions and multiplications would always return `0` regardless of the contents of the passed array. This optimization resulted in the pattern matching case reducing to (an optimization that was unavailable to the `dyn` implementation):

```asm
xor eax, eax
ret
```

After correcting this by setting the seed value to `1`, the benchmarks showed a significant improvement, making pattern matching only **2.7x faster** than dynamic dispatch.

Happy coding! ðŸ¦€

PS: Feel free to raise a PR if you think there is something wrong with the way the benchmarks are designed.
